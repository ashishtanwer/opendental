Some general notes about how dpi works:
This is a starting point, although they gloss over many details and don't really give any good strategies:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/high-dpi-support-in-windows-forms?view=netframeworkdesktop-4.8#configuring-your-windows-forms-app-for-high-dpi-support
OD is dpi aware by default, specifically DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2.
Users can turn this off in one of two ways:
1. Right click exe, Properties, Compatibility, Change high DPI settings, Override, System.
2. Add NoDpi.txt file.
When not dpi aware, the following will all use 96 dpi values:
Form.DesktopBounds, Form.SetDesktopBounds, and Screen.WorkingArea.
This means they will appear proportionally smaller than the real dimensions, which generally works fine.
But these must all be tested in both dpi-aware and non-aware because of lots of little issues.
150% on a 4K monitor is a good testing environment for both.

WPF works in DIPs.
If directly setting a Window.Left or Top, you must convert to windows scale.
Full examples are in WindowComboPicker, ToolTip, and WindowImageFloatWindows.
But I recommend this:
		double scale=VisualTreeHelper.GetDpi(this).DpiScaleX;

Do not use SetDesktopBounds to move a Form.
It will erroneously use the upper left of the working area as 0,0.
If a taskbar is docked left, this will shift your Form to the right by that amount on both screens.
At least on Windows 10.
Instead, use Form.Bounds=...
or Form.Location.
