Background:
In FormODBase, there's a section for FilterControlsAndAction.  Because it's in FormODBase, it's available to all derived forms.  The scenario where it's useful is when you have a group of controls at the top that you're using to filter results that are usually in a grid.  For example, dateStart, isHidden, name, etc.  You don't want the grid to refresh with each keystroke in the name field, and you also don't want to make the user click a Refresh button.  Instead, you can pass in all the controls that you want to "watch".  Then, each time they change, that triggers the refresh, but with less annoyance.  There's a time interval that it waits. For example, if it's set to 1 second, then it waits until typing has paused for 1 second before refreshing.  Since it runs the db query in a background thread, the UI will not lock up during the refresh so that they can keep typing.  The query should be able to safely abort if we need to terminate a previous refresh and quickly start again.

This new class:
We are moving to WPF and away from WinForms, so we need a new class that performs the same functionality.  There will also be some improvements from the old one:
-Separate class instead of embedded in FormODBase. This is a better design. Only available to the forms where you add this class.
-Any grid refresh that is in the action must be moved out.  No UI action in background threads.

How to use:
Add a private Field to your form: 
	FilterControlsAndAction _filterControlsAndAction;
Initialize:
			//This can be in ctr or load event, as long as it's after you've set any initial values for the filters
			_filterControlsAndAction=new FilterControlsAndAction();
			_filterControlsAndAction.AddControl(textName);
			_filterControlsAndAction.AddControl(checkIsHidden);
			_filterControlsAndAction.AddControl(dateStart);
			_filterControlsAndAction.FuncDb=RefreshFromDb;
			_filterControlsAndAction.SetInterval(700); //optional. Default is 1000
			//_filterControlsAndAction.SetMinChars(3);//Don't use without involving Jordan. This prevents queries when chars below this threshold.
			_filterControlsAndAction.ActionComplete=FillGrid;
FuncDb:
		private object RefreshFromDb(){
			//This gets run on a background thread so that the UI will not lock up.
			//call db method
			//You will typically need some parameters, but they are not allowed.
			//So use class level fields or grab the values from UI objects.
			//No UI actions here.  Always forbidden in background threads.
			//You cannot change UI values, but you can safely get them like this:
			string txtProvNum="";
			Dispatcher.Invoke(()=>txtProvNum=textProvNum.Text);
			//If you think you need to set UI values in the action, there are other approaches you could use. For example, maybe a timer instead of this class.
			//Return table, List<>, etc. Whatever object you return is what will then get passed into ActionComplete.  Null is ok.
		}
ActionComplete:
		private void FillGrid(object objectData){
			//This gets run on the main UI thread.
			//You can use a wait cursor if you want, but usually not necessary.
			List<Provider> listProviders=(List<Provider>)objectData;//or whatever type you need
			gridMain.BeginUpdate();
			...Fill the grid like normal.
		}
There may also be situations where you will RefreshFromDb and FillGrid separately from the FilterControlsAndAction.
For example, when your form first loads.
So this is fine: FillGrid(RefreshFromDb()); 
but understand that RefreshFromDb will happen on the main thread in this case, which is totally fine.

Setting this to 3 makes it wait until "smi" is entered, resulting in less useless slow queries. 3 is a typical reasonable number. This is used in FrmPatientSelect(...) along with the pref PatientSelectSearchMinChars. If user backspaces until there are 0 characters, then normally a query would still run and would get a huge list of everything. By setting MinChars, we can prevent that behavior. But a backspace will result in a stale list unless you manually refresh with a button. So a Refresh button is recommended if user wants to bypass MinChars for some reason.</summary>
