Jordan is the only one allowed to edit this file.
Height should always be 21.
One common use use of this control is as a filter for reports, etc.
There should be no problems with this use.  The user cannot "see" clinics that they shouldn't, which is great and very useful.
But we need to be very careful in the case of using this combobox as a picker for fields on an object.
Since clinics with no permission would be hidden, this could inadvertently cause changes in which clinics are linked.  
Also, if the "all" option really means "all", then the calling form must specifically test IsAllSelected. 
"All" should not be used when the intent is ClinicNum=0
If the calling form instead uses ListSelectedClinicNums when All is selected, that's very different, and will exclude clinics not showing due to no permission.
This control is currently used in about 49 places (including the WinForms version).  Many of these are at the top, in the filter section of reports. 
Others are simple fields on objects.
Here are some complex situations to watch out for:
FormEServiceSetup has 4 comboBoxes.  I understand clinicPickerEClipboard, but not the other 3, so I can't police those 3.
FormPatientAddAll has 5 comboBoxes.  They don't include All or Unassigned, and they are all totally harmless, without potential for bugs.
FormPharmacyEdit: Includes All and Unassigned. It's multiselect. Does not test "All".  Because it uses a synch mechanism, clinics that aren't showing aren't affected either way.
FormRxEdit: Does not include All.  Includes Unassigned.  Single select. On save, if no selection, then it doesn't change the existing clinicNum.  Users can get into this window with "unrestricted search" permission, so ForceShowUnassigned true.
FormPatientEdit: Users can access with "unrestricted search" permission, so ForceShowUnassigned true.
FormProcCodes2: This form makes sure that the clinic pickers stay visible, even when clinics are disabled and they'd normally no longer be visible. 
Here's a list of 8 forms with most of the remaining comboboxes that still need to be switched out eventually: 
FormDoseSpotAssignClinicId(pickerbox & picker), FormEhrPatientExport, FormEServicesECR, FormMedLabs, 
FormPayConnectSetup, FormPaySimpleSetup, FormOnlinePayments, FormXWebTransactions

Common Pattern#1, Clinic as a field:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the UI, set these properties:
	IncludeUnassigned=true
	HqDescription="None" //depending on situation
comboClinic.SelectedClinicNum=adj.ClinicNum;
...
adj.ClinicNum=comboClinic.SelectedClinicNum;

Common Pattern#2, Clinic as report filter----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the UI, set these properties:
	IncludeAll=true
	IncludeUnassigned=true
	IsMultiSelect=true
string stringDisplayClinics=comboClinics.GetStringSelectedClinics();
List<long> listClinicNums=comboClinics.ListSelectedClinicNums;
RunReport(listClinicNums,stringDisplayClinics);
