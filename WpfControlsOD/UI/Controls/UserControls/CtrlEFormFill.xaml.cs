	Control Groups:
	Each field is represented by a group of controls.
	For example, we might have a label with a textbox below it. That's one field.
	There are many different ways to stack the controls you need that will depend on your language.
	For the textbox example, we chose a stackpanel with two items, but we could have instead used a dockpanel, a grid, or whatever.
	You should decide on a single container for each field (group of controls).
	The container type can be different for each field type.
	Once you have your various containers for each of the fields, you have to think about how to arrange them.
	In the discussion below, I will refer to these as "fields" instead of "control groups".
	Each "field" is a group of controls that correspond to one eFormField.

	Organization of UI:
	The strategies here are described to be as language agnostic as possible.
	We need to be able to recreate this UI in a variety of languages.
	As you can see in the designer, there is a main vertical StackPanel within a ScrollViewer.
	Each item in the stackPanel is supposed to be a horizontal WrapPanel.
	(unfortunately, we had to put each of these WrapPanels in a grid for our hover, drag, drop, etc. You won't need that)
	These horiz wrapPanels then contain the individual fields which stack horizontally and wrap when needed.
	If EFormField.IsHorizStacking=false, then there will be only one field in that WrapPanel.

	Border Boxes:
	Each field can have an optional border box that can be turned on by the user.
	A border never includes multiple fields.
	This border takes up additional space, making the field look bigger in both dimensions.
	The border does not change the margins and spacing described below.
	The extra white space that's created within the border should be thought of as padding within the field rather then margins between fields.
	The user will never have control over this padding.
	For a fixed width field, the specified width is for the field itself, without the surrounding padding or border box thickness.
	The border itself is not uniform. The bottom takes 6 pixels (5 for shadow) and the other three sides take one pixel.
	The thickness of the border does not contribute to either the padding or the margins of each field.
	So the contents of a field is surrounded by padding + border + margin.
	All of those values are clearly defined here and must be copied precisely in any implementation.
	To make the left edges of fields line up whether they have a border or not, we include left padding and left border thickness whether a border is present or not.
	One way to do that is to define a different border in that case which is white with certain thicknesses.
	Padding and border thickness on the other three sides should only be present when a border is present.
	I want two label fields to be able to get very close to each other vertically when there is no border.
	In C#, the way to make this work is for the field to be a child of the border. A C# border can have thickness, margin, and padding.

	Margins and spacing:
	I apologize for the complexity of this code. 
	Anyone using this code to try to build a UI in a different language should use a much simpler approach.
	You will not have to support drag, drop, hover, and selection in the setup window.
	So try to imagine it simpler:
	There must be a certain amount of white space around each field (or around each border box).
	You must have a very solid plan for how to create this white space. There are lots of ways to get it wrong.
	Each of these spaces is well defined at the class level below.
	Variables are best because we will gradually be giving users more control.
	For example, they now have control over vertical spacing below each field.
	We plan to give them control over more spacing in the future.
	Since this section is about margins, it's really the white space between border boxes.
	None of this has anything to do with border thickness or padding.
	Each field should have right and bottom margins.
	It's required to do it this way because of how we give users control.
	It also works great with various stacking scenarios.
	By simply adding a right and bottom margin to every field,
		 you get both spacing between fields as well as the overall bottom and right page margins.
	The StackPanel and WrapPanels should then certainly not have right or bottom margins,
		 because those were already handled by field margins.
	All that remain are the left and top margins of each page.
	Create this whitespace by giving left and top margins to the main StackPanel.
	Be aware that we do plan to eventually give users direct control over these two margins as well.
	In our overly complicated code that you see below, we don't do it as described above.
	Make sure to do it as described above, the simpler way.

	Calculation of Width of Each Field:
	The calculation of width is contained in a new method: CalcFieldWidth
	The complexity increased significantly with the addition of percentage width fields.
	DO follow my exact algorithm for calculating the width for each field.
	There's not a shorter way to do it.
	Here's why:
	It's important to set each field to have a fixed width and auto height.
	The fixed width is necessary for it to work in the horiz wrapPanel.
	The auto height is necessary for textboxes that have wrap turned on and will grow vertically
	   or for radiobuttons that consume more than one row for example.
	But we have a big problem: The fixed width of the field must be able to shrink when the screen is too narrow.
	Without this, multiline textboxes will spill off to the right,
	   and single line textboxes will also not scroll horizontally like they should,
	   and radiobutton options will get cut off.
	Unfortunately, there is no combination of control properties that will achieve this behavior.
	I've tried lots of different kinds of nesting, max width, stretch, etc. The complexity explodes.
	Furthermore, the math must work for both fixed widths and percentage widths.
	And whatever I come up with here must be very easy to implement in any UI language.
	I decided that we must always calculate each field width ourselves as part of layout.
	We still put them in a wrapPanel, and we leave the heights auto, but we must calculate the widths.
	So set the width of each field container very intentionally according to my algorithm.
	To determine available width, subtract the right margin (ex 10) from the StackPanel width.
	The controls inside the field can stretch horizontally to fill; that's easy.
	Once we do the math to set each field width, it all works automatically.
	This math can be done in any UI language.
	It also follows that if the screen size changes, we must redo the layout.
	But screen size really shouldn't be changing unless the user maybe rotates the layout.

	Tags:
	Tags are used as follows:
	1. Each EFormField in the list has its TagOD set to the field(borderBox actually) that it's associated with.
			One purpose is to allow us to pull values from the UI into our EFormField objects.
			Another purpose is to allow our highlighting for hover effects and selection in the setup window,
				but the patient UI does not need highlighting, so that can be ignored there.
			These tags also allow "paging" by collapsing the fields not on the current page.
			Finally, the tags allow collapsing for conditional logic.
	2. We also have DragLocation tags on the various borders that we use for drag/drop.
			The patient UI clearly does not need those.

	Heirarchy of controls:
	This heirarchy is unique to this C# implementation.
	It will be different and simpler in any other language because no support for setup is needed.
