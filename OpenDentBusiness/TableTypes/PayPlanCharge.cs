/*
Allen, Omar, and Jordan had a meeting on 2024-11-15 to try to understand the schema.
Payplans original version used this table for charges only. The production was stored on the payplan table as a single number.
When payplans version 2 was added, the ChargeType column was added.
	Credits (1): Production (Procedures, Orthos, Adjusts)
	Debits (0): The charges due
Then, Dynamic Payment Plans (DPP) were added.
PayPlanLink was added for Credits (Production). The old ChargeType column does not use Credits for DPPs.
Omar's research showed that old Payment Plans didn't have a way to view all productions, instead relied on the ProcNum column of associated PayPlanCharges.
Unclear if ProcNum is still used since DPPs have no Credits. Probably not.
PayPlanLink.AmountOverride allows user to lock the amount of a production entry so it won't change. Otherwise, if you change a proc fee, the PayPlanLink uses that number.
Allen says Sean is an expert
