EForms is a complete replacement for the mobile version of sheets for patient forms. 
It's also designed to be used on larger devices so that it can replace sheets being used for webforms.
We will probably not be able to completely deprecate mobile sheets immediately, but we will try very hard for most customers.
EForms are fillable from within OD, although we do not really expect this to be used very much -- maybe for consent forms? 
Patients will eventually be able to fill out EForms online in the web version of eClipboard and also on eClipboard in the office. And eventually on a Windows App.

Relationship to Sheets:
We did a good job on sheets, but we never should have tried to adapt sheets for mobile dynamic layout. We should have just started over. Now we are.
Once EForms is mature and powerful, we might add a way to convert a mobile sheet into a more powerful EForm.
Since EForms is intended to replace Mobile Sheets, we need to explain how to do the same things here that we did there.
Sheets are laid out in absolute x,y coords, with some additional growth behavior built in.
EForms are entirely dynamic
Mobile sheets had no positional control but were instead just stacked vertical scrolling.
EForms is still stacked vertical scrolling, but there are also horizontal stacking options mixed in.
Internal EFormDefs are hard coded in C#, just like internal sheets.
Whenever a user first starts using eForms, all the internal eForms are immediately converted to custom and stored in the db.
An EFormDef is editable. User can add/remove/rearrange EFormFields.
Sheets stored database link as FieldName. EForms uses DbLink.

Comparison of field types:
Sheet OutputText and InputField are combined into a single type called TextField.
StaticText has been renamed Label.
Nearly identical in both: Checkbox, ComboBox, and Signature.
Not supported in EForms: StaticImage, PatImage, Line, Rect.
Additional in EForms: PageBreak, DateField, RadioButton

Allergies and Problems:
These are particularly difficult.
Medications is not included here because it's even harder and requires its own special control.
Allergies and Problems are handled similarly. I'll use allergy as an example.
In the first version, we support a series of checkboxes that get prechecked if the patient has that allergy.
All of these text boxes will have DbLinks that look like "allergy:..."
We also provide an "allergyOther" textbox to enter allergies not in the main list.
The "allergyOther" textbox is comma delimited and importable.
The "allergyOther" textbox gets prefilled for all existing allergies that are not handled by checkboxes.
Any import not matching an existing allergy in OD gets imported as an allergy called "Other", with the name stored in the note field.
A "none of the above" box works as a group with the checkboxes and allergyOther to support IsRequired.

Insurance
Import is extremely difficult, so we will mostly not automatically import, and then just add features to help with that.
The import process of sheets and eForms in general will just need a lot of attention later.
We might add a button just for Ins import since everything else will be done automatically.
We need to consider where to put various import notes. Flex uses Service Notes for some of it. Commlog entry?
We might also recommend a checkbox to indicate if insurance has changed. Maybe that should trigger some sort of warning for the office.

Language Translation
(still working on this documentation)
For radiobuttons, we must concat label and all radiobutton labels.
PickListVis holds the radiobutton labels for the English version.
We ignore PickListDb because those won't change with different languages.
Our delimiter will be comma. Like this:
Example Label,Radio1Span,Radio2Span
Radiobuttons are already validated to not contain commas.
Do the same for radiobutton labels, English version.
Neither labels nor radiobuttons require visible labels.
So PickListVis might already look like ",,"
and ValueLabel might also look like ""
The translation allows empty strings as well, regardless of whether English has empty strings.
A translation could also look like ",,,".
The number of items in the translation is critical and must match.
Rename VisDb to VisDbLang and add a third field.
Add another column to the grid if this is not default language.
They are allowed to change both the English and foreign translations in that grid at any time.

Font size
This is discussed in a few different places:
EFormField.FontScale discusses how we use default sizes as 100% and then scale from there.
EFormField.ValueLabel discusses conversion of font sizes in FlowDocuments.
EFormField.Width discusses how the size of other elements relates to font sizes.
It's worth mentioning that Sheets use 12 point font by default, which is bigger than the WinForms UI font of 8.25.
This is done for printing reasons. eForms don't generally print, so we care more about UI fonts.
Our 11.5 default WPF font is quite a bit smaller than the 12 point font used in Sheets.

	///<summary>EForms are a way for patients to fill out forms. This is similar to sheets, but optimized for dynamic layout instead of fixed layout. The office sets up templates, EFormDefs, which get copied to EForms. Since this is a template EForm, it does not link to a patient. It can be freely changed without affecting any EForms. We also supply internal EFormDefs, which are hard coded as XML rather than being in any office database.</summary>

/*
Flex has multiple videos on how they do their setup. Here's one:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V-wbDuVtFg 
Ours are similar.

Enhance FormWebForms to include eForms. I don't think eForms get retrieved, but do they still show on that form?
	For sheets, they show if DateTimeSheet is within search range and IsWebForm is true.
	eForms uses Status instead of IsWebForm
	For eForms, DateTimeShown is the field that is analagous to DateTimeSheet. 
	Both are the dates that show at the lower left of the fill window,
	and both are the dates used for showing in commlog and also indicate when they were filled out.
(done) Slight enhancements to FormPatientPickWebForm for wording
WebForms_Preference.ColorBorder
Background color
Permission to edit complete EForm, use Sheet permission?

Future Allergies, Problems, Medications:
There are many possible future improvements. Some are listed below in order of priority, with allergies as an example:
A current list of allergies along with a formal way to add/remove.
This list control could be combined with the custom checkboxes or yes/no boxes to avoid the need for an "other" textbox.
Flex uses categories that get expanded. Those don't look useful to me.
Medications are more complex than Allergies and Problems, so we use a special control.

Future enhancements, in order of priority:
Address same for entire family checkbox
Carryover when filling multiple forms in one session. (not needed if Address same for family is done right)
Branding, using colors, logos, and images, using MobileBrandingProfile.
Signatures
	SignatureBoxWrapper.GetIsTypedFromWebForms()
	DateTimeSig: ??
	CanElectronicallySign: ??
	IsSigProvRestricted: not needed because provs don't sign patient forms

Automate language translations somehow?
Convert all translations from mobile sheets 
Lists for Allergies, Problems
Allergies and meds, more elegant options than Other.
Tools to combine meds and probs, like we already do with allergies.
Columns of checkboxes, probably possible now. Test
TextArea specify rows showing initially
Validator and formatter for zip, state, phone, email, etc.
Fontname
SigBox encryption rather than just the drawing.
ComboBox
Listbox for lists that are shorter than a comboBox, but longer than a radioButton group.
Multiselect listbox. Probably done with visual aid by adding a checkbox to each item because they can't use Ctrl key to multiselect.
We already support unselecting all radiobuttons to represent another state in the db. Example: For Marital Status, you might only show Married and Child, excluding Divorced and Single from the pick list. The unselected state then represents no change, so an existing patient could leave both radiobuttons unchecked and their status would remain Divorced or Single. The enhancement is that we would allow them to uncheck if they accidentally checked or if already checked, and the result would be unchanged or default. This will clearly require a few unit tests, or at least specific written scenarios.
Global EForms FontSize adjustment which would multiply all fields by this percentage.
Misc fields that are not importable also prefill for subsequent updates.
In label edit window, rich text box. The following are technically very difficult, so we don't have time to do them yet. They can be listed as annoyances.
	Text remain highlighted when in font window.
	Text selection follow pointer better instead of automatically selecting entire word
	Support mixed formatting in the selection, font window being aware of that third state.
Label edit window, icons and fancier toolbar functionality like pick font size in toolbar.
Radiobuttons for referral sources in addition to the textbox

Enhancements we will not add:
Multiselect radioButtons. Use a multiselect listbox instead
Checkbox to indicate import. No need because that's what DbLink indicates.
