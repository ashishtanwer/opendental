	///<summary>HQ only table for daycare. One entry is made in this table each time a child or teacher goes to a room or to unassigned and also any time the allowed ratio changes. A major purpose is to track child/teacher ratios. Each row will either be an entry for a child, teacher, or ratio change. For example, if the entry is for a child then the ChildNum column will have a number and the ChildTeacher and RatioChange columns will be zero. The actual ratio is never stored in this table and must be derived from many rows.</summary>
